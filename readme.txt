1 - Please Download the code from this repo as a zip, inflate and work on your local copy 
2 - The assignment consists of completing the code in the domain of knights tournaments simulation to make pass the existing junit tests. 
3 - Go to read the testing code to find further  details. 
4 - The Difficulty is increasing : Please solve tests one by one, we would like to see your approach of solving the problem;  we do not want the perfect solution poping out of the box.
5 - Keep in mind that this is a session to assess your coding skills : your coding style is as important as passing all the tests.
6 - Please write the code exactely as you would like to support it in production, no more no less.

7 - Anyone can make mistakes... but this kata has been run literally hundreds of times. If something feels odd it's very unlikely that it would be coming from the exercise. 
8 - You're not allowed to change the tests.

Good luck! (& hf!)
